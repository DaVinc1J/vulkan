# davincij vulkan

the point of this project is to create a basic graphics renderer with Vulkan, tho it is really only a learning project and i hope to try to implement many of the libraries myself later. idk if ill try stbi tho haha. the main plan is to create a really optimised renderer that efficiently does stuff.

## overview

built with vulkan, shown with glfw. plan to add some more ui stuff for bug testing but need to create a basic renderer first. wanna try ray tracing and lighting stuff tbh
